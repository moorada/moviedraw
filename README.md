# 🎥 Home Cinema - Movie Draw

A simple web app for picking movies anonymously with friends.

## What it does

Everyone secretly adds a movie they think others haven't seen. The app randomly picks one. You only find out who suggested what after watching!

## How to use

1. Open the HTML file in any browser
2. Pass your phone around
3. Each person adds their movie suggestion
4. Hit "Draw" when everyone's done
5. Watch the chosen movie
6. Reveal who picked what afterwards!

## Features

- Anonymous movie suggestions
- Random selection
- Simple, mobile-friendly interface
- Works offline

## Technical stuff

Just a single HTML file with CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks, no dependencies, no server needed.

## Why I made this

Got tired of spending 30 minutes debating what to watch. This forces a decision and adds some mystery to movie night.

Feel free to use, modify, or improve it however you want!
